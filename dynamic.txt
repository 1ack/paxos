our state is given by
P : { p : process } - set of processes

each process has a set of received messages
each process may broadcast a message

MS : { <m, p> : m - message, p - sender process} - messages sent
MR : { <s, m, p> : s - sequence number, m - message, p - receiving process } - messages received


correctness criteria for for dynamic membership:
    every process will have a contiguous sub-sequence of all messages that have been received by at least one process
    every subsequence of messages received by a process will start with a welcome message
    if a process receved messages p and q, with seq numbers sp and sq then that process has received all messages with sequence numbers between sp and sq
    a process will never recieve a message with a seq no n+1 that is not a welcome message if it hasn't received the message with seq no n

a leader must know if any message has been accepted by previous leaders


a process will not accept a message that is not chosen
a process will not accept two messages for the same seq#
a leader will never broadcast success for a message that is not chosen
