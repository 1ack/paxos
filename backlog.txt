remove memory leaks

remove redundant messages
    the leader should not send a success if it has already been sent for that seqNo

message loosing system test
    create a messanger that looses a given percentage of messages

message reordering system test
    create a messanger that reorders messages for different members

process killing system test
    create a test that starts multiple VMs and kills the leader

message fragmentation
    UDP supports up to 64kb messages

measure performance
    create a proper performance test

view changes
    we need completely dynamic group membership
    when a new member joins we must start the transition
    during the transition messages are broadcast to the old view and the new view
    during the transition the quorum is reached only if both the quorums of the old view and new view are reached
    the transition is complete when all members of the old group have received the success message for all messages before the transition started
    we might need to separate the concept of view from the messenger
    what happens if there is another new view during the transition?




persistent state?
    do we need it?
